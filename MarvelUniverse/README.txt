Project for my university course.
It is basically a graph that represents characters from the marvel universe
Every Vertex is a character and every edge is a book. Edges represents connections between characters that appeared in the same book
Main purpose of the graph is to find path made of books between characters
A goal was to make the search no more than 30 seconds long. This implementation takes around 30 seconds
I made another implementation in C++ which lasts a few seconds.
